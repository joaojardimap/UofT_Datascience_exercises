# Foundations of Data Science | University of Toronto

This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of my coursework, laboratory exercises, and projects for the **Foundations of Data Science** course at the University of Toronto (UofT).

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey as I explore the intersection of **Computer Science** and **Statistical Inference**. The contents focus on using computational thinking to solve real-world problems through data analysis.

> **Current Status:** 🚧 Work in Progress (Week 2)  
> This repository is updated weekly as the curriculum progresses through more advanced data science concepts.

## 🎓 Academic Context
The course curriculum covers the fundamental pillars of Data Science, including:
* **Computational Thinking:** Designing efficient algorithms for data processing.
* **Statistical Foundations:** Understanding randomness, probability distributions, and sampling.
* **Data Exploration:** Visualizing patterns and cleaning complex datasets.
* **Inference:** Testing hypotheses and making predictions using linear models.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Primary Language:** Python
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks
* **Core Libraries:** (To be expanded) `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `SciPy`.
